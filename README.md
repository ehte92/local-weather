## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**  | The codebase follows a modern front-end architecture using Vue.js as the main framework. The project is structured as a single-page application (SPA) with multiple components and views. It adopts a component-based architecture, separating the application into reusable and self-contained components, such as CityView, SiteNavigation, CityCard, etc. The Vue Router is used for navigation between different views. The architecture allows for easy reusability, maintainability, and scalability of the codebase.                                                                      |
| **üìñ Documentation** | The repository lacks comprehensive documentation. Although some files have code comments explaining their purpose and functionality, there is no centralized documentation or README file explaining the project's overall structure, setup instructions, or usage guidelines. This can make it challenging for new developers to understand and contribute to the project. Improved documentation would greatly benefit the project's usability and onboarding process.                                                                                                                         |
| **üîó Dependencies**  | The project relies on several external dependencies, such as Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and Font Awesome. Vue.js is a widely-used JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, providing the core functionality of the application. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework used for styling the components. Font Awesome provides a library of icons used in the project. The dependencies are managed using npm and can be found in the package.json file. The project also relies on external APIs, such as OpenWeatherMap and Mapbox, to fetch weather data and search for locations. |
| **üß© Modularity**    | The codebase demonstrates good modularity by organizing the project into smaller, reusable components. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the application's functionality, such as displaying weather information, handling navigation, or rendering placeholders. This modular approach allows developers to understand and modify specific parts of the application without affecting others, enhancing code maintainability. However, further modularization could be achieved by extracting common functionality into shared modules, reducing code duplication.           |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**       | The codebase does not include any explicit tests. Lack of tests can make it difficult to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application. Implementing a comprehensive testing strategy, such as unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the overall functionality, would improve the quality and stability of the code. Popular testing frameworks for Vue.js applications include Jest and Vue Test Utils, which could be considered for future test implementation.                                                                                          |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**  | The project does not present any obvious performance issues. However, performance optimization techniques, such as lazy loading of resources, code splitting, and caching, could be implemented to enhance the loading speed and overall performance of the application. Additionally, minimizing the use of heavy external libraries or optimizing API calls can further improve performance. Monitoring tools like Lighthouse or WebPagetest can be used to                                                                                                                                    |

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).

```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```

4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.

```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```

6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command

```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```

7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
   The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
